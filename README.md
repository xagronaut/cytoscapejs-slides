# Talk: Cytoscape.js: Graph Your DevOps Landscape
![](GraphYourDevOpsLandscape.png)

## Abstract
Who hasn't been frustrated by all of the moving parts in a complex system? Configurations change constantly to get work done, and it's nearly impossible to manage.

It can be hard to track, and building models that quickly become obsolete is unrewarding. Visio is for people with more time than you!

**Cytoscape.js** is an open source graph visualization library for working with connected data. Complete with layout engines, search algorithms, and animation, Cytoscape.js can make you look like a diagramming expert.

Come see a real tool created with Cytoscape.js to model deployment environment configuration using familiar data sources.
